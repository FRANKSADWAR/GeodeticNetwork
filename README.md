# GeodeticNetwork
Web GIS to manage geodetic networks in Kenya.
Geodetic Networks existing in Kenya are sparse, the data can only be obtained from the Survey Of Kenya and surveyors face a challenge of knowing 
whether the geodetic stations are available or missing.
On the other hand, leveraging web GIS technology in the field can assist surevyors in knowing which stations to use and whether they available or not.
The system, was created with open source tools, Geo Django, PostGIS and PostgreSQL database and the Leaflet mapping library.

Surveyors can then upload a file, in GeoJSON format, of the piece of land they want to take measurements on, theyw will then be able to visualize the geodetic stations within the vicinity that they can use.

The surveroys can also report ob the status of a control station that is undocumented, which can later be reviewed and then dcoumented as a valid geodetic station.
